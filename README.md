# Doodle-classifier
This is a doodle classifier made using CNN.


<h1> Doodle Classifier </h1>

###  This is a real time doodle classifier that asks the user to draw a picture of an object taken from the 20 classes defined in its database, then uses the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Learning to guess the drawing. Similar to Quick, Draw! by Google: ###

<h1> Dataset </h1>

### The dataset consisted of 2807037 total images of size 28x28 which were grouped into 20 classes, out of which, 2045200 images were used for training and 761837 for testing. ###

<h1> Libraries </h1>

**1. Matplotlib- used for plotting graph of cost vs epochs and displaying images of dataset
2. Numpy- used to represent images as arrays (pixel by pixel), and to perform matrix operations 
3. OpenCV- used for making the virtual drawing pad
4. Pytorch- library used for Machine Learning applications using GPUs and CPUs, has automatic differentiation and other functions used in this project which makes the code cleaner and easy to implement.**
